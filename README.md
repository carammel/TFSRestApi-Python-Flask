I developed this application to see Azure DevOps artifacts. My main approach is to be clear and open to anyone in the company. Everyone should see the results of pipelines, releases, and also who has access to the projects. 

I developed this web app on flask and python. I used Azure Devops Restapi queries to show the data.

There is a main python file I called it app.py. It contains POST and GET requests.

# Flask
First Flask project for showing datas from TFS(http and https) restapi
Mixture of TFS RestApi and Flask
I am tring to make a web page for all people in my company who want to check their project's builds, commits, members ext. 

Download data to excel and get data of all commits independent from projects.
